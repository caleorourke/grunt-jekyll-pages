# Contributing Guidelines

grunt-jekyll-pages is hosted, developed, and maintained only on GitHub. This repository follows the <a href="http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">fork-pull model</a> and leverages issues and pull requests for source control, bug fixes, and new features. Anyone is welcome to submit a request, but we ask that you follow a few simple guidelines in regards to:

* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
* [Issue Reporting](#issue-reporting)

## Pull Requests

We accept all types of pull requests, just as long as they stay within scope and don't break compatibility downstream. If you're unsure about what impact your request might have, send us a [feature request](#feature-requests) first. This gives us a chance to vet it before you start working on something that we might decide not to merge.

To create a pull request:

1. Fork repo from GitHub: `http://github.com/caleorourke/grunt-jekyll-pages/fork`
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "add some sweet features"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create a new Pull Request in GitHub
