# Contributing Guidelines

grunt-jekyll-pages is hosted, developed, and maintained only on GitHub. This repository follows the <a href="http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">fork-pull model</a> and leverages issues and pull requests for source control, bug fixes, and new features. Anyone is welcome to submit a request, but we ask that you follow a few simple guidelines regarding:

* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
* [Issue Reporting](#issue-reporting)

## Pull Requests

We accept all types of pull requests, just as long as they stay within scope and don't break compatibility downstream. If you're unsure about what impact your request might have, submit a [feature request](#feature-requests) first. This gives us a chance to vet it before you start working on something that we might decide not to merge.

To create a pull request:

1. Fork repo from GitHub: `http://github.com/caleorourke/grunt-jekyll-pages/fork`
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "add some sweet features"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create a new Pull Request in GitHub

## Feature Requests

## Issue Reporting

Here are some suggestions to help guide you through escalating it to us.

#### Search issues already in GitHub

All issues are bagged and tagged in GitHub. Click <a href="http://github.com/caleorourke/grunt-jekyll-pages/issues" target="_blank">search</a> and make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

#### Provide information about your setup

This includes versions, when was it installed, what you're trying to do, and so on.

#### Gauge its severity, impact, and occurrences

#### Share code pastes in Gist

Paste any code, logs, or errors into a page on <a href="http://gist.github.com" target="_blank">Gist</a> and drop the link in the issue.

#### Use our template to write-up your issue
